    <!-- We shouldn't use CDN links for react because everytime we use , they make a network call
        2. It is difficult to manage the react version, currently we have 18 only, in future if we have 18.1 or some other minor
        version too, we need to update these links manually.
        3. That's why, we prefer installation of react by using npm. It is good practice. It is preferable because we have react
        as a dependency in package and package-lock json files. 
    -->

    <!-- React has hosted on CDN officially. we want to inject react into our code so we need react js file because react is js library.
     Browser only knows js, browser only have js engine so we don't need to inject any thing new for js, but we need to do it for react
     because browser doesn't know about react. and CDN provides script file for react.
     react-dom is used for rendering react components into the dom. -->
