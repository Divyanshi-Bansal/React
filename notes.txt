2. normal: used in production also

caret vs tilde in Dependency:
- caret (^): when we use caret (^) it upgrades the minor version if available not major. so it is safe to use
- tilde (`): It's used when we want major upgrade if available


package.json vs package-lock.json

    - It tracks which version is installed in your system
    - There is caret and tilde to upgrade the version acc.
- package-lock.json: 
    - it locks the version, and keep the record of every exact version which is installed

node modules:
- collection of dependencies
- fetch all the code from npm and stores in node modules
